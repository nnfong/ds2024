\section{Introduction}
In this report, I used implementation of the Word Count example using a custom MapReduce-like approach.
\section{MapReduce Implementation}
\subsection{Mapper Function}
The mapper function (\texttt{map}) reads input lines and extracts words, converting them to lowercase and removing non-alphanumeric characters. It then emits key-value pairs where the key is the word and the value is 1.
\subsection{Reducer Function}
The reducer function (\texttt{reduce}) aggregates the counts for each word by summing up the values associated with the same key. It then prints the word and its total count.
